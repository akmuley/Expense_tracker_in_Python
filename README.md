# Expense Tracker 

A simple Python expense tracker that stores data in a CSV file and prints a monthly summary.
This code has input validation, safer error handling, and a small text menu loop.

## Features
- Add expenses/income to a CSV file
- Monthly summary (expense, income, balance)
- Input checks (date, month, amount)
- Friendly error messages
- Basic tests with pytest

## Run
```bash
python expense_tracker.py
```

## Test
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

## Why this project
I built this to practice Python basics: file handling, functions, validation, and unit tests.
